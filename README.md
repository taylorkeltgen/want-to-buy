  ## User Story

  AS a Buyer I want a place to make a post of an item I “want to buy”.
<br>
WHEN I login I can make a post, add a description, select a category, and add a price I'm willing to pay for the listed item.
<br>
THEN a Seller is able to contact me via my registered email to continue the transaction.
